                    Firebase Authentication for google OAuth, and implemented Discord OAuth support from scratch since at the time Firebase did not have support for Discord OAuth. Firestore was used
                    as a database to store the link between the two accounts, and a ban table which bans certain ucsd emails from verifying themselves with the Bot in any server.

                    Back in 2021 when Voice Synthesis was not as easily accessible, I collected voice clips from my professor's lectures, labeled them, and fed them into Tacotron and Talknet models to clone his voice (with permission).
                    I compared the strengths and weaknesses of each of the models, conducted surveys to see if I could fool other students into believing the synthesized audio was real, and had made some fun audios out of it. Nowadays you just need a couple of seconds of audio and some services like Voicelabs or whatever the service is called.

                    Given a review text of an anime, can I predict whether it is shounen or not shounen, adventure or not adventure? Using Scikitlearn's Linear Regression module and text mining techniques like TF-IDF and Bag of Words, I attempted to solve just that. I also tried out some techniques like limiting the vocabulary of a genre's model to that of only the words used in reviews of that genre which significantly improved performance, which led to talk about why some theories and talk about why some genres are harder to predict than others.
